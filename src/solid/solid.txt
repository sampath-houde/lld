S - Single Responsibility Principle
O - Open/Closed Principle
L - Liskov Substitution Principle
I - Interface Segregation Principle
D - Dependency Inversion Principle


## S - Single Responsibility Principle
A class should handle only one responsibility. It should not deviate from what it is supposed to do

## O - Open/Closed Principle
A Class already written in production should be open for extension and closed for modification.

## L - Liskov Substitution Principle
objects of superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses.

## I - Interface Segregation Principle
A class should not be bound to implement any functionality if it does not use. Here the interface should be separated or segregated into more and defined interfaces.
I and L principles often solves violations of others.

## D - Dependency Inversion Principle
High Level Modules should not depend on low level modules directly. This violation is solved using interfaces, abstract classes
